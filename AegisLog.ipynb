    "Log files are machine-generated records of events happening inside your system or application. Every login attempt, error message, service restart, or user action leaves a trace. A basic log entry includes:\n",
    "- A Timestamp\n",
    "- Severity Level ($\\texttt{\\color{lightblue}{INFO}} \\texttt{/} \\texttt{\\color{Yellow}{WARNING}} \\texttt{/} \\texttt{\\color{Red}{ERROR}}$)\n",

    "Logs give us visibility into how our systems behave and what is causing failures, slowdowns or security risks. They help us:\n",
    "- **Troubleshoot faster:** Logs show exactly what happened, when and what triggered it, so that we can trace the root cause without guessing.\n",
    "- **Spot performance issues early:** Repeated errors or slow API calls often show up in logs before they trigger alerts.\n",
    "- **Detect threats in real time:** Logs are often the first sign that something isn't right, like a series of failed logins or strange firewall activity."

    "\n",
    "Modern cybersystems heavily rely on logs as one of the primary forensic evidence during legal proceedings, audits, cyber incidents etc. However, what happens if an adversary gains access to these logs and modifies them? **Traditional logs are written in plaintext**, **can be easily edited, deleted and reordered**, and lastly, **rarely provide cryptographic proof of integrity**. Once an advesary gains access and elevates access priviledges, traditional logs are no longer trustworthy. This project designs and implements a tamper-evident logging system that ensures:\n",
    "- Every log entry depends on all previous entries\n",
    "- Altering one entry breaks the entire chain\n",
    "- Verification can be done later by an investigator\n",
    "\n",
    "**This project is NOT about preventing attacks**. The design goal is _tamper evidence_, NOT _tamper prevention_. Traditional logging systems do not provide cryptographic guarantees of integrity and evidence of tampering under adversarial conditions. Thus, making them unsuitable for forensic use after system compromise."
